            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Thor is imprisoned on the other side of the universe
             without his mighty hammer and finds himself in a race
             against time to get back to Asgard to stop Ragnarok—the
             destruction of his homeworld and the end of Asgardian
             civilization—at the hands of an all-powerful new
             threat, the ruthless Hela. But first he must survive
             a deadly gladiatorial contest that pits him against his
             former ally and fellow Avenger—the Incredible Hulk!</p>
