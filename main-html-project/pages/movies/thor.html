        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Thor is imprisoned on the other side of the universe
         without his mighty hammer and finds himself in a race
         against time to get back to Asgard to stop Ragnarok—the
         destruction of his homeworld and the end of Asgardian
         civilization—at the hands of an all-powerful new
         threat, the ruthless Hela. But first he must survive
         a deadly gladiatorial contest that pits him against his
         former ally and fellow Avenger—the Incredible Hulk!</p>
