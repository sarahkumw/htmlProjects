        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>As a young boy, Bruce Wayne watched in horror as his millionaire 
        parents were slain in front of him--a trauma that leads him to 
        become obsessed with revenge. But the opportunity to avenge his 
        parents' deaths is cruelly taken away from him by fate. Fleeing to 
        the East, where he seeks counsel with the dangerous but honorable 
        ninja cult leader known as Ra's Al-Ghul, Bruce returns to his now 
        decaying Gotham City, which is overrun by organized crime and other 
        dangerous individuals manipulating the system. Meanwhile, Bruce is 
        slowly being swindled out of Wayne Industries, the company he 
        inherited. The discovery of a cave under his mansion, along with a 
        prototype armored suit, leads him to assume a new persona, one which 
        will strike fear into the hearts of men who do wrong; he becomes Batman!!!</p>
