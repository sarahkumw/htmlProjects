        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Iron Man tells the story of Tony Stark, a billionaire 
        industrialist and genius inventor who is kidnapped and 
        forced to build a devastating weapon. Instead, using his 
        intelligence and ingenuity, Tony builds a high-tech suit 
        of armor and escapes captivity. When he uncovers a nefarious 
        plot with global implications, he dons his powerful armor 
        and vows to protect the world as Iron Man.</p>
