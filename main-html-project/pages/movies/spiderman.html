            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>A young Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland), who made 
            his sensational debut in Captain America: Civil War, begins 
            to navigate his newfound identity as the web-slinging super 
            hero in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Thrilled by his experience 
            with the Avengers, Peter returns home, where he lives with 
            his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), under the watchful eye of his 
            new mentor Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.). Peter tries to 
            fall back into his normal daily routine - distracted by 
            thoughts of proving himself to be more than just your friendly 
            neighborhood Spider-Man - but when the Vulture (Michael Keaton) 
            emerges as a new villain, everything that Peter holds most 
            important will be threatened.</p>
