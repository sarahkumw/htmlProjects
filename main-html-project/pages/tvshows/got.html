        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Based on the best-selling book series "A Song of Ice and Fire" 
        by George R.R. Martin, this sprawling HBO drama is set in a world 
        where summers span several decades and winters can last a lifetime. 
        From the scheming south and the savage eastern lands, to the frozen 
        north and ancient Wall that protects the realm from the mysterious 
        darkness beyond, the powerful families of the Seven Kingdoms are 
        locked in a battle for the Iron Throne. This is a story of duplicity 
        and treachery, nobility and honor, conquest and triumph. In the Game 
        of Thrones, you either win or you die.</p>
